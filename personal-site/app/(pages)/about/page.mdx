# About

My name is Christopher Baillie Olin. If you know me professionally,
you probably know me as Chris. If you know me personally, you probably
call me Baillie. Either is fine with me.

I am a software engineer based in Brooklyn, NY, with a strong background in Python and interests across many languages.

In 2022, I graduated from the University of Maryland, with a dual degree in computer science and mechanincal engineering.
My technical interests include (but are not limited to) programming languages, compilers, generative AI, and electronics.

In my free time, I like listening to music and spending time outdoors.
I like road cycling, mountain biking, road cycling, hiking, camping, rock climbing, and disc golf.
I love the Pacific Northwest because it serves as an excellent setting for all
of these things, and is beautiful year-round.
