# This Website

This website is a work in progress.
It is meant to be a living resume, where I can show colleagues, employers, friends and family about myself, my interests, and my accomplishments.

It is a static site written with NextJS, and hosted on Amazon S3.
The about page, as well as each individual project subpage, are compiled dynamically from markdown to HTML.
If you'd like to take a look at the code, it's available [on my Github](https://github.com/olincb/website-2).


In the future, I plan on including a page dedicated to art I've created.
I also plan on making some of my projects interactive, and making pages for them.
