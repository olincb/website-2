# `co_mit`

`co_mit` is a simple, AI-assisted command line tool to help the commit process for a set of code changes.
It is built as an agentic LLM workflow with tools that keep the user in the loop.

The user must supply an OpenAI API key via environment variable, but after that usage is as simple as `> co_mit`,
followed by approvals as the tool gathers information about the current changes in the codebase,
decides which files to add to the commit, comes up with a suitable commit message, and performs the commit.

It comes with the ability to configure a commit example, to support specific commit message formats.
Without additional specification, it defaults to the widely used [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

See the code, as well as usage examples, [on my GitHub](https://github.com/olincb/commit-helper).
