# Old Website

The first iteration of this website, while no longer live, has its source code available [on my Github](https://github.com/olincb/website).

It was a dynamic site, written in Ruby on Rails, and hosted in an AWS Lightsail instance.
The about page, as well as each individual project subpage, were compiled dynamically from markdown to HTML.
To add a new project to the site, all I had to do was write a new markdown file, put it in the correct folder, and push the changes to the main branch of the GitHub repository; the rest was handled automatically by a cron job on the AWS Lightsail instance.
