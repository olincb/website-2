# `bkmk`

`bkmk` is a simple command line tool written in Rust that allows the user to bookmark a directory and return to it by invoking an alias for it.

I mainly developed this tool for myself as a quality of life improvment at work.
Typically, projects that I may need to navigate between regularly could be located in deeply nested folders on my computer.
This tool allows me to reference any of my projects by a simple alias, and navigate to them quickly.

This project is pretty much as utilitarian and straightforward as they come;
it pretty much serves as a CRUD wrapper for a YAML file in the user's home directory.
Despite its simplicity, I use this project most regularly of anything I've worked on.

Check out the code and some usage examples [on my GitHub](https://github.com/olincb/bkmk).
